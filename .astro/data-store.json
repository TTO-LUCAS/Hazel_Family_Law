The recent decision in *Rhodes v Bass (2025)* offers important guidance on how courts balance parental rights with the paramount need to protect children and carers from harm.\n\n## **Background**\n\nIn *Rhodes v Bass*, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia considered parenting orders made by consent, which allowed the father unsupervised time with the children on alternate weekends and during school holidays.\n\nFollowing allegations of family violence and findings from child protection authorities, the Court was asked to determine whether the mother’s decision to withhold the children breached those orders, and if the orders themselves needed to be changed.\n\nThe case highlights a critical principle: even final consent orders can be revisited when credible evidence of risk or family violence emerges.\n\n## **What the Court Found**\n\n**1. Contravention of orders acknowledged**\n The mother admitted she had not complied with the orders by withholding the children from the father.\n\n**2. Reasonable excuse established**\n Under the *Family Law Act 1975* (Cth), a parent may be excused from breaching an order if they genuinely believe it is necessary to protect the health or safety of a child or another person.\n\nThe Court accepted that the mother’s concerns were well-founded, and supported by:\n\n* Criminal convictions for family violence and sexual offences\n\n* Repeated breaches of Intervention Orders\n\n* Reports from the Department of Communities and Justice (DCJ)\n\n* Disclosures from the eldest child indicating fear and distress\n\n**3. Orders modified for safety**\n Given the evidence, the Court found that unsupervised time was no longer appropriate and ordered that the father’s time be supervised.\n\n**4. Child protection reports were key**\n The Court placed significant weight on the findings of DCJ and other agencies, reinforcing how child-protection input can shape final decisions.\n\n## **Key takeaways from *Rhodes v Bass***\n\n#### **Safety always comes first**\n\nEven when parents have reached agreement, consent orders are not immune from change. Where credible evidence of harm exists, the Court will prioritise safety above any prior arrangements.\n\n#### **Evidence matters**\n\nCriminal findings, Intervention Orders and child protection assessments all carry significant weight. The more substantiated the evidence, the stronger the Court’s capacity to act decisively.\n\n#### **The “Reasonable Excuse” standard is real**\n\nThis case clarifies that parents who genuinely act to protect a child or themselves, supported by credible evidence, may have a lawful defence for withholding contact.\n\n#### **Supervised time protects relationships**\n\nWhen risk is identified, supervised contact can balance two objectives: protecting children while maintaining a relationship with both parents, if it can occur safely.\n\n#### **Bring concerns forward early**\n\nIf you have fears for your safety or your children’s wellbeing, raise them as soon as possible. Courts expect transparency and evidence, not assumptions or delay.\n\n## **For parents navigating similar situations**\n\nIf you are separating, or have existing parenting orders and are worried about safety, consider these steps:\n\n* **Document everything:** Keep records of incidents, police involvement, Intervention Orders or reports from child protection authorities.\n\n* **Seek advice early:** Do not wait until after orders are made to raise safety issues.\n\n* **Understand your options:** “Reasonable excuse” is not a loophole, it is a safeguard when risk is real and supported by evidence.\n\n* **Explore supervision:** In some cases, supervised contact provides a safe interim solution.\n\n* **Know your obligations:** Breaching court orders can have serious consequences, but justified protection measures are recognised under the law.\n\n## **What that means for families**\n\n*Rhodes v Bass* reinforces that the safety of children and carers is the foundation of all parenting decisions. Courts will not hesitate to vary or limit contact arrangements where violence or abuse is substantiated.\n\nFor families navigating these issues, the message is clear: the law is increasingly responsive to genuine risk, and support is available to help protect your family’s wellbeing.\n\n## **Clear and compassionate support when you need it most**\n\nAt **Hazel Family Law & Mediation**, we understand that safety concerns can make family law matters especially complex and distressing. Our role is to provide calm, clear guidance so you can make informed decisions that prioritise your and your children’s wellbeing.\n\nIf you are concerned about existing parenting orders or need advice about family violence or child protection issues, we offer a **free 30-minute initial appointment** to help you understand your options and the next steps forward.","src/content/blog/another-test-blog.md","19c8d68183c669aa",{"html":24,"metadata":25},"\u003Cp>Family law in Australia continues to evolve, particularly where parenting orders intersect with family violence and child protection concerns.

For many, the process of separation or parenting disputes can bring up memories of distress, fear, or loss; and for some, these experiences may involve trauma. At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, we recognise that legal guidance is most effective when it is delivered with understanding, patience and awareness. This is the foundation of what is known as trauma-informed care.\n\n## **What Is trauma-informed care?**\n\nTrauma-informed care is an approach that recognises the widespread impact of trauma and understands that people’s experiences of distress can affect how they think, feel and respond, including during stressful legal processes.\n\nIn simple terms, it means acknowledging that trauma is real and that it can influence every aspect of how a person engages with their lawyer, the court or mediation. Rather than focusing solely on legal issues, a trauma informed approach considers the whole person and strives to create a safe, supportive environment where they can participate fully and make clear, confident decisions.\n\nTrauma can arise from many sources, historical experiences,  family violence, coercive control, financial abuse, neglect, or even prior experiences with the legal system. It can affect anyone. A trauma informed lawyer understands these effects and tailors their communication and approach to reduce stress and avoid re-traumatisation.\n\n## **Why it matters in family law**\n\nFamily law matters often unfold at deeply emotional times, where clients are already vulnerable. For someone who has experienced trauma, traditional legal processes, with their adversarial tone, deadlines and detailed questioning, can sometimes feel overwhelming or even unsafe.\n\nAdopting a trauma informed approach ensures that every interaction, from the first phone call to final resolution, is handled with care and awareness. It allows the lawyer to recognise signs of trauma, respond appropriately and create space for clients to feel seen and supported.\n\nIn practical terms, trauma informed practice in family law might include:\n\n* **Creating physical and emotional safety**: ensuring meetings and communications occur in environments where the client feels secure.\n\n* **Promoting choice and control**: empowering clients to set boundaries and make decisions at a pace that works for them.\n\n* **Building trust and transparency**: explaining legal steps clearly, so clients know what to expect and feel informed throughout the process.\n\n* **Recognising and respecting emotional triggers**: understanding that certain questions or topics may be distressing and adjusting communication accordingly.\n\n* **Collaborating with support professionals**: working alongside counsellors, psychologists or social workers to ensure holistic care.\n*\n\nThis approach does not slow down the legal process: it enhances it. When clients feel safe, informed and respected, they can participate more effectively and make better decisions for themselves and their families.\n\n## **What it means for clients**\n\nFor clients, trauma informed care means being treated with empathy and dignity. It means your lawyer listens, truly listens, and adapts their approach to meet your needs.\n\nAt Hazel Family Law & Mediation, this may look like:\n\n* Taking time to explain each step before it happens, so you feel prepared and in control.\n* Offering flexible ways to communicate, whether that is in person, online, or through written updates, to suit your comfort level.\n\n* Being mindful of the language we use, avoiding legal jargon and using plain, reassuring communication.\n\n* Allowing breaks during meetings or mediation if emotions become overwhelming.\n\n* Encouraging the involvement of your support team; family members, therapists or advocates, where appropriate.\n\n\nOur aim is to ensure that the legal process does not add to the distress you may already be experiencing. Instead, we want to create an environment where you feel supported, understood and empowered to make the choices that are right for you.\n\n## **How trauma-informed practice supports better outcomes**\n\nWhen clients feel emotionally safe and respected, they are better able to engage with the legal process, remember key information and make thoughtful decisions. That can lead to clearer communication, more effective negotiation, and ultimately, more sustainable and peaceful resolutions.\n\nTrauma informed care also benefits families and children. When parents are supported and guided in a calm, compassionate way, they are better equipped to focus on what matters most, their children’s wellbeing and stability. A trauma informed approach helps reduce conflict and fosters a more constructive environment, allowing all parties to work toward balanced, child-focused outcomes.\n\nImportantly, this approach also enhances property and financial discussions.\n\nFor many separating couples, conversations about money, assets, and financial contributions can be highly charged and emotionally confronting, especially where there has been financial control, coercion or imbalance during the relationship. A trauma informed lawyer recognises these sensitivities and ensures that discussions occur in a way that minimises distress and promotes fairness. By creating space for clients to express their concerns without fear or shame, and by proceeding at a pace that feels safe, the process becomes more transparent and constructive. This often leads to more practical and balanced financial settlements, outcomes reached through clarity and respect, rather than pressure or fear.\n\n## **Trauma informed care at Hazel Family Law & Mediation**\n\nAt Hazel Family Law & Mediation, we see every client as more than just a case file. We recognise that each person’s story is unique, and often layered with emotional and practical complexities.\n\nOur team are experienced in working with clients who have experienced family violence, coercive control or other forms of trauma. We take the time to listen, explain and support you through every step of the process. Where needed, we work collaboratively with other professionals, including counsellors, psychologists, and social workers, to ensure your needs are met holistically.\n\nOur ethos — **Clarity. Compassion. Resolution.** — guides everything we do.\n\n* **Clarity**, so you understand your rights, options and next steps.\n\n* **Compassion**, so you feel safe and supported throughout your journey.\n\n* **Resolution**, so you can move forward with confidence and peace of mind.\n\n\n## **Moving forward with confidence**\n\nTrauma informed care is not about dwelling on the past; it is about recognising it, understanding its impact and ensuring the legal process does not cause further harm. It is about creating a pathway forward that feels safe, balanced and empowering.\n\nIf you are facing family change, or if your circumstances involve family violence or trauma, you don’t have to navigate the process alone.

Many people are surprised to learn that the *Family Law Act 1975* (Cth) (**FLA**) does not set out a single simple formula for who gets what. Instead, the Court applies a structured decision-making process developed over time through both legislation and case law.\n\nThe aim is always to reach an outcome that is “just and equitable”, that is, fair to both parties, considering the full story of their financial and non-financial contributions and their current and future circumstances.\n\n### **Identifying the property pool**\n\nThe first step is to identify all property, assets and liabilities held by either or both parties. That includes everything from real estate and savings to superannuation, debts and possibly even informal family loans. This forms the property pool that the Court will consider. In recent reforms, the Act makes it clear that liabilities are now formally part of this process, ensuring that debts are recognised alongside assets.\n\n### **Considering Contributions**\n\nThe Court looks at each person’s contributions to the relationship. These include:\n\n* **Financial contributions**, such as income, savings or property brought into the relationship.\n* **Non-financial contributions**, such as home improvements or unpaid work in a business.\n* **Contributions as homemaker and parent**, which are valued as equally as financial contributions under the law\n\nImportantly, the Court can also consider how family violence may have affected a person’s ability to contribute. For example, if one party’s contributions were made significantly more difficult because of violence or coercion, this may be taken into account in achieving a fair division.\n\n### **Looking at current and future circumstances**\n\nThe Court considers what each person needs moving forward. Factors include:\n\n* Income and earning capacity.\n* Health and age.\n* Care of children and housing needs.\n* Financial responsibilities and liabilities.\n\nAgain, the Court can also consider how the effects of family violence may impact a person’s current or future circumstances. For example, if one party requires ongoing therapeutic support or is unable to work.\n\nThe reality is that separation can affect people differently. One party may have reduced earning capacity due to time out of the workforce caring for children, while the other may have greater financial security. The goal is to balance those circumstances fairly.\n\n### **Deciding what is just and equitable**\n\nThe Court looks at the overall fairness of the proposed division. Even if the calculations appear balanced, the Court must be satisfied that the practical outcome of the proposed division is just and equitable in the specific circumstances of each case.\n\nThat does not mean a 50/50 split; it means an outcome that reflects the genuine contributions and future needs of each party in their particular circumstances.\n\n### **What this means for you**\n\nEvery family’s situation is different. The Court’s framework is designed to create structure around decision making, while tailoring solutions around your personal circumstances.\n\nEven when your matter is being resolved through negotiation, mediation or family dispute resolution, lawyers and mediators will often refer back to what a court would likely do in the same situation. That is because the FLA and the case law provides the framework that guides all property settlements, whether inside or outside the courtroom. Even if you reach agreement privately, any consent orders you ask the Court to make must still meet the “just and equitable” test. The Court will not simply “rubber stamp” an agreement; it must be satisfied that the outcome is fair and consistent with the law.\n\nWorking within that framework from the start is not just about getting an agreement approved, it is about reaching an arrangement that feels fair, balanced and sustainable for everyone involved, and one that gives you confidence and stability moving forward.\n\n At **Hazel Family Law & Mediation**, we help you navigate this process with clarity and care, whether you are negotiating privately, through mediation or before the Court.

While the process can feel daunting, taking a considered and informed approach can help you reach a fair and lasting resolution. Below are some key steps to help you move forward with clarity and confidence.\n\n#### **1. Get sound legal guidance early**\n\nFamily law is complex and constantly evolving. It’s important to seek advice from an experienced family lawyer who can explain your options, outline the likely process and provide tailored advice specific to your circumstances. Having clear guidance from the outset helps you make confident and well-informed decisions.\n\nIt is essential you feel comfortable with, and trust, your lawyer. Good communication, mutual respect and a sense that you are being heard form the foundation of a strong working relationship. There may be times when you receive advice that is difficult to hear, but having that trust allows you to work through those moments constructively.\n\n#### **2. Be open and transparent**\n\nHonesty is an important foundation for achieving a positive outcome. Be forthcoming with your lawyer about your parenting circumstances, financial position, and any other relevant matters, even those that may feel awkward or uncomfortable.\n\nYour lawyer can only protect your interests when they have a complete understanding of your situation. The more accurate and detailed the information you provide, the better they can prepare your case and anticipate potential challenges.\n\n#### **3. Keep your focus on the children**\n\nWhen children are involved, their wellbeing must be at the centre of decision making. This means supporting safe relationships with both parents, where appropriate, and making arrangements that meet each child’s individual needs.\n\nSometimes, what is best for your children may differ from what you would prefer personally. Keeping their needs as your priority helps them feel secure and supported as they adjust to new family arrangements. If your children are struggling, seek professional support promptly to help them navigate the changes in a healthy way.\n\n#### **4. Gather and organise your documents**\n\nBeing well-prepared helps your matter progress more smoothly. For property or financial disputes, collect documents that show what you owned at the beginning of your relationship, what you contributed throughout, and the current details of your assets, debts, and superannuation. Older records can be particularly useful if there is disagreement about past contributions or ownership.\n\nIf you are struggling to collate those documents, then speak to your lawyer about the best way to source them, and the easiest way to get them to your lawyer to review. \n\n#### **5. Follow court orders and directions**\n\nIf your matter proceeds to court, it is essential to follow all court orders and directions carefully. Non-compliance can have serious consequences and may impact your credibility and outcome.\n\nYour lawyer should ensure you understand what is required at each stage of the process. Never hesitate to ask questions, clarity reduces stress and helps you meet your obligations confidently.\n\n#### **6. Be cautious on social media**\n\nSocial media can easily become a source of evidence in family law cases. Posts, photos or comments, whether public or private, may be taken out of context and used to challenge your position. That can include posts made by you, your friends or family members about your ex-partner, your children, or your case.\n\nEven if you believe your accounts are private or inaccessible, screenshots can circulate quickly. For your protection, avoid posting or commenting about your separation, your children, or any legal issues. Keep those discussions entirely private.\n\n#### **7. Be willing to resolve matters cooperatively**\n\nWhere possible, aim to resolve matters through negotiation or mediation rather than through the court process. Settling outside of court is usually faster, more cost-effective and less emotionally draining. It also supports more respectful communication—something especially important when ongoing co-parenting is required.\n\nIt’s understandable that many people want their “day in court,” particularly when they feel wronged or unheard. However, court proceedings rarely provide the emotional closure people hope for. The process can be lengthy, expensive and emotionally exhausting. Even if you need court involvement, remain open to settlement opportunities at every stage.\n\n#### **8. Be receptive to advice**\n\nThroughout your matter, you will receive guidance from various professionals, your lawyer, barrister, valuers, child experts, mediators or judicial officers. At times, their advice may be unexpected or difficult to accept. Remember, their role is to give you an informed and realistic assessment based on their experience and expertise.\n\nYou are, of course, free to make your own decisions. However, if you choose not to follow advice, make sure you fully understand the possible implications. Genuine consideration of professional advice is key to achieving the best possible outcome.\n\n#### **9. Prioritise your wellbeing**\n\nSeparation and family disputes can be emotionally taxing. Maintaining your wellbeing helps you stay calm, think clearly and make balanced decisions. While your legal team is here to support you, they are not mental health professionals, and emotional care is an essential part of the process.\n\nIf you are struggling, seek professional support such as counselling or therapy. Speak with your lawyer about affordable options that suit your circumstances. \n\nAt **Hazel Family Law & Mediation**, we are happy to work collaboratively with your broader support team, whether that includes family members, counsellors, financial advisors or others, so you feel supported from every angle.","src/content/blog/how-to-achieve-the-best-possible-outcome-in-your-family-law-matter.md","efdae41f506beed2",{"html":153,"metadata":154},"\u003Cp>Family law issues often come at times of significant personal change.

When lawyers become involved, emotional stress is often compounded by financial strain. At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, we believe it’s important to be open and honest about why costs can escalate, so that you can make informed, confident decisions with clarity.\n\n## **Why so many costs?**\n\n#### **1. Multiple Layers of Work**\n\nWhen you engage legal services in family law matters, whether for parenting arrangements, property settlement or relocation, there is often far more work involved than most people anticipate. That can include gathering documents, advising you, drafting applications, negotiating, preparing for mediation, managing disclosure, consulting with experts, attending court events and more. Each step requires time, care and expertise.\n\nHourly rates for specialist family lawyers in Australia typically range between **$350 and $1,000 (plus GST)** per hour. As a general guide:\n\n* **Senior solicitors** (Principals, Partners or Special Counsel): $550 to $1,000 per hour\n\n* **Mid-tier solicitors** (Senior Associates or Associates, with 4 to 10 years’ experience): $450 to $650 per hour\n\n* **Junior solicitors** (1 to 4 years’ experience): $350 – $500 per hour\n\n\nNot all family lawyers charge the same, and there are valid reasons for that. Rates generally reflect a combination of experience, specialisation, and practice setting. Solicitors with many years of focused family law experience tend to charge more than generalist practitioners.\n\nLocation also matters: firms with offices in city centres often have higher overheads than suburban or regional practices, and those costs can flow through to client fees. The size and structure of the firm also play a role. Larger firms typically have higher fixed costs, while boutique firms may offer more flexibility.\n\nFinally, a lawyer’s ethical stance on billing and firm overheads can make a real difference. At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, our approach is grounded in fairness and transparency, ensuring fees are proportionate to the work required and always clearly explained.\n\n#### **2. Court fees and compulsory expenses**\n\nEven if your matter settles early, there are mandatory external costs that cannot be avoided such as court filing fees, hearing fees and expert reports. For example, the current filing fee for initiating a combined parenting and financial application (for both interim and final orders) is approximately $585, and divorce applications are around $1,125.\n\n#### **3. Complexity matters**\n\nThe more complex your circumstances, the greater the potential cost. When children, substantial assets, business interests or complex financial structures are involved, it may be necessary to engage valuers, child experts or other specialists.\n\nLess complex matters might be resolved for between $5,000 and $40,000, while more complicated ones can exceed $80,000, assuming court proceedings can be avoided. Once a case enters the court system, however, costs escalate rapidly. It is not uncommon for fully contested matters to exceed $100,000 or more by the time they reach trial.\n\n#### **4. Time, delay and the adversarial process**\n\nThe longer a matter continues, the more legal time is required and the higher the cost. A recent *ABC News* investigation (*“$1m on legal fees and feeling powerless”*, 2024) reported parents spending over $300,000 on legal fees, mediation and expert reports, only to have their matter adjourned on the first day of hearing.\n\nDelay adds not just to cost but to emotional exhaustion. It can also erode goodwill, making cooperation and settlement harder as time passes.\n\n#### **5. Expectations and behaviour can influence cost**\n\nWhile many families find themselves caught in costly proceedings through no fault of their own, sometimes expectations or behaviour can unintentionally drive conflict and expense. Unrealistic expectations, often shaped by no, poor or overly optimistic legal advice can lead to prolonged disputes and disappointment.\n\nIn other situations, one party may unfortunately use the legal process as a means of maintaining control, creating financial or emotional pressure on the other parent. The family law system is designed to promote fairness and protect children’s wellbeing, but it can be misused when cooperation and good faith are lost.\n\n## **Why this matters to you**\n\nIt is not only about money. When costs escalate:\n\n* The budget you hoped to dedicate to your or your children’s future may instead be consumed by legal fees.\n\n* Time, energy and emotional resources are drawn into the dispute rather than constructive family change.\n\n* The original issues can become overshadowed by the process itself.\n\n\nAt Hazel Family Law & Mediation, we believe you deserve a process that is respectful, cost-aware and focused on resolution. We also understand that in some circumstances, particularly where there are safety concerns or ongoing family violence, the court process is necessary and appropriate.\n\n## **What you can do to help manage costs**\n\nYou have some control over how the process unfolds. There are practical ways to reduce cost and maintain focus:\n\n* Be clear about your goals early. The sooner you and your lawyer identify your objectives and assess what is realistic, the less time and cost will be spent refining strategy later.\n\n* Choose mediation or negotiation where possible. A November 2024 *Relationships Australia Victoria* report found that for every $1 spent on family dispute resolution, families saved about $20 in avoided court costs (an average saving of around $41,800).\n\n* Keep documentation and disclosure organised. Missing or incomplete information causes delay and duplication. Being proactive and cooperative helps streamline your matter.\n\n* Be realistic about complexity and timeline. Recognise early if your case involves multiple issues (such as children, business interests or relocation) and plan accordingly.\n\n* Discuss budget and strategy openly. Ask your lawyer for realistic estimates, and talk about when it may be time to negotiate or settle.\n\n* Stay child-focused. Keeping discussions centred on what is best for your children, rather than on winning, usually leads to faster, healthier and more affordable outcomes.\n\n* Ask your lawyer how you can minimise costs. Sometimes small habits, for example. consolidating questions into one email rather than sending several, can make a meaningful difference.\n\n## **Finally**\n\nFamily law matters are rarely simple. The stakes; your children, your family’s future and your financial stability are deeply personal. Costs can mount quickly when the process becomes protracted or adversarial. With early, honest advice and a thoughtful strategy, you can stay in control of both the process and the outcome.\n\nAt Hazel Family Law & Mediation, we are committed to guiding you through with **clarity, compassion, and resolution**. We’ll help you understand your options, make informed decisions, and work toward outcomes that support your family’s wellbeing, while being mindful of cost.\n\nIf you are facing a family law matter and want to explore your options, please reach out.

Whether supervision is needed because of safety concerns, a long period apart, or ongoing conflict between parents, it is natural to feel uncertain about what to say. With the right approach, however, you can help your child feel calm, safe and supported throughout the process.\n\n\n\n## **What is professional supervision?**\n\nProfessional supervision is a structured arrangement designed to ensure that a child can spend time with a parent in a safe and supported environment.\n\nIt may be recommended in situations involving:\n\n* Family violence or safety concerns;\n\n* High levels of parental conflict;\n\n* Questions around a parent’s capacity or circumstances; or\n\n* The need to reintroduce a parent to a child after time apart.\n\n\nSupervised visits can take place at a professional contact centre, in a public setting such as a park or library, or sometimes in someone’s home. A qualified, independent supervisor is present for the duration of the visit, including during changeover. The supervisor observes the interaction, takes notes, and prepares a report that may be provided to both parents (or their lawyers) and, where required, to the Court.\n\nThe purpose of professional supervision is to help a child maintain a relationship with their parent in a way that protects them from physical, emotional, or psychological harm, and shields them from parental conflict.\n\nThis principle is underpinned by section 60CC of the *Family Law Act 1975* (Cth), which guides how the Court determines what is in a child’s best interests. Key considerations include:\n\n* Promoting the child’s safety and protection from exposure to family violence, abuse, neglect or harm;\n\n* Assessing each parent’s capacity to meet the child’s emotional, developmental, and cultural needs; and\n\n* Supporting a relationship with both parents, where it is safe to do so.\n\n\n## **The practicalities, cost, frequency and duration**\n\nProfessional supervision is usually provided by independent contact centres or private supervisors.\n\n* **Cost:** Fees vary depending on the provider and location, but typically range from $80 to $150 per hour for centre-based supervision. Community-based supervision will likely cost more. Weekend visits are usually more expensive than weekday visits. Some providers also charge for intake interviews, changeovers and written reports.\n\n* **Frequency:** How often supervision occurs depends on the child’s needs, any court orders and progress between visits. Often, financial constraints and availability of supervisors, will limit visits to less than the supervised parent would like. Some families begin with short, weekly sessions; others start less frequently and gradually increase the length or regularity of visits as circumstances improve.\n\n* **Who pays:** Usually the parent whose time is supervised will be asked to pay, although the Court and the parties can agree otherwise.\n\n* **Duration:** Professional supervision is not intended to be an indefinite arrangement. It is usually a temporary and transitional measure, allowing a parent-child relationship to continue safely while risk factors are managed or trust is rebuilt. Over time, and with positive progress, supervision can often move toward unsupervised or more flexible arrangements. If a child cannot transition safely into unsupervised time, then it may be that the Court needs to decide how best to manage the relationship, potentially limiting time to quarterly or bi-monthly visits only.\n\n\n\n## **New requirements for professional supervisors**\n\nIn recent years, new national standards have been introduced to strengthen the quality and safety of supervised contact services. If you are choosing or working with a professional supervisor, it is important to be aware of these evolving requirements:\n\n* **Accreditation and training:** Supervisors must now meet minimum standards for training and suitability. This includes completing recognised supervision or child-contact service training and engaging in ongoing professional development.\n\n* **Independence:** Supervisors must be independent, they cannot be a family member, friend, or therapist of either parent, and must be free from any conflict of interest.\n\n* **Accredited services:** National accreditation standards for Children’s Contact Services are being implemented, with formal accreditation to apply across Australia from June 2025. Parents should confirm that their chosen service or supervisor complies with these standards.\n\n* **Child-safety checks:** Supervisors and service providers must hold appropriate child-safety clearances, such as a Working With Children Check and a police history check, and have no record of relevant domestic or child-protection orders.\n\n* **Record keeping:** Supervisors are required to keep detailed and accurate records of visits, including observations, incidents, and compliance with court orders, and may be called upon to produce reports for the Court.\n\n\nWhen selecting a supervision service, ask about:\n\n* The supervisor’s qualifications and experience;\n\n* How the service ensures compliance with child-safety and professional standards; and\n\n* Whether the service is, or will soon be, accredited under the new national framework.\n\n\nThese reforms aim to ensure that supervised contact arrangements remain safe, transparent, and consistent across Australia, while reinforcing that supervised time should be a stepping stone toward more independent contact where safe and appropriate.\n\n\n\n## **Talking to children about supervision**\n\nExplaining supervised time to a child can feel daunting, especially if they have experienced family conflict or if it has been some time since they last saw their parent. The way you approach this conversation will depend on your child’s age, maturity and understanding, as well as the reasons supervision is needed.\n\nHere are some gentle, practical suggestions:\n\n* **Use clear and simple language.** Explain who they will be seeing, where the visit will take place, and what will happen in straightforward, age-appropriate terms.\n\n* **Reassure them about safety.** Let your child know that another adult will be there to make sure everyone feels safe and comfortable. You might explain that no one is in trouble, the supervisor is simply there to help the visit go smoothly.\n\n* **Familiarise them with the setting.** If possible, visit the location in advance so your child feels more comfortable on the day.\n\n* **Seek professional support.** If your child is seeing a psychologist or counsellor, they can help you find the right words and may raise the topic in a therapeutic setting.\n\n* **Direct them to reliable information.** Older children and teenagers may wish to explore the **Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia’s “Kids’ Zone”** at[ www.fcfcoa.gov.au/kids](https://www.fcfcoa.gov.au/kids). This website provides child-friendly explanations about family law, court processes, and, in brief, what supervised time means.\n\n\nEncouraging your child to access clear, age-appropriate information can help reduce confusion or anxiety, and help them feel reassured that many families experience similar arrangements.\n\n\n\n## **How we can help**\n\nAt **Hazel Family Law & Mediation**, we have extensive experience supporting parents through complex parenting arrangements, including those involving supervision orders and family violence.\n\nWe understand the sensitivity of these situations and are committed to providing clear, compassionate and practical guidance every step of the way.\n\nIf you need advice about supervised time or any aspect of your parenting","src/content/blog/test-blog.md","d3ff97c1ffe994ba",{"html":246,"metadata":247},"\u003Cp>When a child’s time with a parent needs to be supervised, it can be difficult to know how to explain to a child what is happening, and why.
