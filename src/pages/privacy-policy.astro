        This Privacy Statement applies to Hazel Family Law & Mediation (Hazel).
        The words ‘we’, ‘our’ and ‘us’ are used to refer to Hazel. ‘You’ and
        ‘your’ refer to you as the person whose personal information Hazel may
        collect and maintain. <br /><br />
        Hazel collects, uses and discloses personal information relating to various
        individuals in the course of providing our clients with legal advice, marketing
        our services and running our business. As a legal practice, protecting the
        confidentiality and privacy of information is fundamental to our professional
        relationships.
        <br /><br />
        Hazel is bound by the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act)
        and the Australian Privacy Principles in its collection, security, storage,
        use and disclosure of personal information. This information describes how
        we will handle personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act and
        the Australian Privacy Principles. We will review and may update this Privacy
        Policy from time to time. The current version will always be available on
        this website.
      </p>
      <h3>Collection of personal information</h3>
      <p>
        Hazel collects personal information in order to provide professional
        services to our clients and to operate and market our legal practice
        business. <br /><br />
        We will usually collect personal information directly from you; however, we
        may also collect information from third parties, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>insurers;</li>
        <li>your employer;</li>
        <li>other service providers including health service providers; or</li>
        <li>publicly available sources.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        The personal information we collect and maintain may include your:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>name;</li>
        <li>address;</li>
        <li>contact details;</li>
        <li>information relating to your business; or</li>
        <li>
          information about other parties that you may or intend to conduct
          business with.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may also collect sensitive information, including health information,
        about individuals.  We will only collect sensitive information if the
        individual has consented, or if the collection is otherwise in
        accordance with the Privacy Act.  For instance, where the collection of
        sensitive information is required by law or necessary for the
        establishment, exercise or defence of a legal or equitable claim.
        <br /><br />
        If you do not provide us with personal information that we request, we may
        not be able to communicate with you or meet our professional obligations to
        you.
      </p>
      <h3>Accessing our website and electronic publications</h3>
      <p>
        When you access our website or electronic publications we do not use
        your browsing information to identify you personally.  We may collect
        information such as the webpages you access on our site, the documents
        you download and the type of browser you use.  This information is
        anonymous and is used to assess the effectiveness of our communications.
        <br /><br />
        Accessing our website may cause a small file called a “cookie” to be stored
        on your computer.  Cookies allow us to make the information on our website
        more accessible and effective and can avoid you receiving the same information
        from us repeatedly. Most internet browsers are initially set up to accept
        all cookies but you can change the settings in your browser to refuse all
        cookies or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to your computer, giving
        you the choice whether to accept it or not.
      </p>
      <h3>Use and disclosure of personal information</h3>
      <p>
        Hazel uses and discloses personal information it collects for the
        primary purposes of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          providing legal services to clients, ensuring our service commitment
          to clients is met, and to advise individuals about related matters;
          and
        </li>
        <li>
          meeting our internal professional and business requirements, including
          marketing our legal practice business.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may also disclose personal information to our third-party service
        providers in connection with the provision of ongoing or case specific
        services. Where your personal information is provided to these third
        parties, they are required to abide by the Australian Privacy Policy and
        use the personal information provided for the sole purpose of supplying
        their specific services.
      </p>
      <h3>Disclosure of personal information overseas</h3>
      <p>
        Prior to disclosing your personal information to any overseas recipients
        we will take reasonable steps to ensure the overseas third party uses
        the personal information for the purpose intended and does not breach
        the Australian Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h3>Storage and security of personal information</h3>
      <p>
        Hazel takes all reasonable steps to protect the personal information we
        hold from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or
        disclosure.  Most information is held in hard copy or electronic
        records, which may only be accessed by the directors, principal and
        employees of Hazel in the performance of their duties.  We will take all
        reasonable steps to ensure that all third-party service providers who
        hold your personal information are bound by appropriate contractual
        obligations regarding the protection, disclosure and use of the
        information.
        <br /><br />
        The principal and all employees are subject to confidentiality obligations
        as well as being bound by this policy.
      </p>
      <h3>Access and correction of personal information</h3>
      <p>
        Hazel will provide you with access to your personal information held by
        us unless there is a reason why we are not required to do so under the
        Privacy Act.  Under the Privacy Act, you have a right to request access
        to, and correction of, your personal information.
        <br /><br />
        We have processes in place to ensure our records remain accurate, complete
        and up to date, including by verifying the information with you each time
        you use our services.  We will correct any inaccurate or out-of-date information
        within a reasonable time of notification of error.
        <br /><br />
        These records are generally retained for 7 years.  If the information is no
        longer required by us for any purpose for which it was collected and is no
        longer required by law to be retained by us, we will destroy or de-identify
        the information. If we deny you access to, or we refuse to correct your personal
        information, we will provide you with our reasons for the decision.
      </p>
      <h3>Direct marketing and your privacy</h3>
      <p>
        We may distribute general information and newsletters regarding our
        services to our clients. If we believe it may be of interest to you we
        may, from time to time, supply you with specific information regarding
        some of our products and services. We will always provide a simple
        ‘opt-out’ option with this kind of correspondence. Alternatively, you
        may update your preferences by contacting our office.
