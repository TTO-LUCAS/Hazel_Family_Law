Elisa is a trusted family lawyer known for her straightforward advice, quick wit and generous sense of humour, qualities that help clients feel supported while navigating complex and often emotional family law matters.

Practising exclusively in family law since 2016, Elisa also brings a strong mediation background, having worked as a family dispute resolution practitioner since 2012. This experience underpins her pragmatic, solutions focused approach and her ability to tailor advice to the unique needs of each family. She is particularly attuned to matters involving vulnerability, including mental health challenges, substance use, family violence and high conflict parenting arrangements.

Elisa has extensive experience assisting clients affected by family violence and regularly acts in complex parenting and property disputes. She has a strong track record of resolving property without court intervention, while remaining a determined litigator when required. In recent years, she has also successfully supported clients seeking to relocate with their children interstate.

A member of the LIV and Law Council of Australia, Elisa also volunteers with WIRE and contributes to family violence and legal support panels. Her lived experience as a parent in contested proceedings brings added empathy, insight and practical understanding to her work.
