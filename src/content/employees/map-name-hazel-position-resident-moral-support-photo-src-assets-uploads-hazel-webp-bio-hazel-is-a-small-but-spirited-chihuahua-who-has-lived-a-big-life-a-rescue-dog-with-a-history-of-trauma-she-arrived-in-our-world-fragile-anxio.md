Hazel is a small but spirited chihuahua who has lived a big life. A rescue dog with a history of trauma, she arrived in our world fragile, anxious and missing more than a few teeth but with undeniable determination and an instinct for survival.

Despite her size, Hazel embodies strength, courage and resilience. She may be tiny, but she has a big presence, a strong sense of justice and a surprising bite when pushed. She is gentle and cautious, yet fiercely tenacious when it matters most.

Hazel is not the namesake of our firm but she inspires the ethos behind it. Her story reflects the values we hold:
Quiet strength
Compassion rooted in lived experience
Protectiveness without aggression
Standing firm when needed
Recovering, rebuilding and moving forward 
Hazel reminds us every day that even those who feel small, overwhelmed or uncertain deserve steadfast support and a clear path forward.

You won’t see Hazel in client meetings - she spends most of her time napping, supervising from a warm blanket or offering emotional support to the team - but her spirit is woven into the culture of our practice.

At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, we strive to reflect what she teaches us: 
Be gentle. Be steady. And when the moment calls for it - be brave.
