Family law issues often come at times of significant personal change. While the process can feel daunting, taking a considered and informed approach can help you reach a fair and lasting resolution. Below are some key steps to help you move forward with clarity and confidence.

#### **1. Get sound legal guidance early**

Family law is complex and constantly evolving. It’s important to seek advice from an experienced family lawyer who can explain your options, outline the likely process and provide tailored advice specific to your circumstances. Having clear guidance from the outset helps you make confident and well-informed decisions.

It is essential you feel comfortable with, and trust, your lawyer. Good communication, mutual respect and a sense that you are being heard form the foundation of a strong working relationship. There may be times when you receive advice that is difficult to hear, but having that trust allows you to work through those moments constructively.

#### **2. Be open and transparent**

Honesty is an important foundation for achieving a positive outcome. Be forthcoming with your lawyer about your parenting circumstances, financial position, and any other relevant matters, even those that may feel awkward or uncomfortable.

Your lawyer can only protect your interests when they have a complete understanding of your situation. The more accurate and detailed the information you provide, the better they can prepare your case and anticipate potential challenges.

#### **3. Keep your focus on the children**

When children are involved, their wellbeing must be at the centre of decision making. This means supporting safe relationships with both parents, where appropriate, and making arrangements that meet each child’s individual needs.

Sometimes, what is best for your children may differ from what you would prefer personally. Keeping their needs as your priority helps them feel secure and supported as they adjust to new family arrangements. If your children are struggling, seek professional support promptly to help them navigate the changes in a healthy way.

#### **4. Gather and organise your documents**

Being well-prepared helps your matter progress more smoothly. For property or financial disputes, collect documents that show what you owned at the beginning of your relationship, what you contributed throughout, and the current details of your assets, debts, and superannuation. Older records can be particularly useful if there is disagreement about past contributions or ownership.

If you are struggling to collate those documents, then speak to your lawyer about the best way to source them, and the easiest way to get them to your lawyer to review. 

#### **5. Follow court orders and directions**

If your matter proceeds to court, it is essential to follow all court orders and directions carefully. Non-compliance can have serious consequences and may impact your credibility and outcome.

Your lawyer should ensure you understand what is required at each stage of the process. Never hesitate to ask questions, clarity reduces stress and helps you meet your obligations confidently.

#### **6. Be cautious on social media**

Social media can easily become a source of evidence in family law cases. Posts, photos or comments, whether public or private, may be taken out of context and used to challenge your position. That can include posts made by you, your friends or family members about your ex-partner, your children, or your case.

Even if you believe your accounts are private or inaccessible, screenshots can circulate quickly. For your protection, avoid posting or commenting about your separation, your children, or any legal issues. Keep those discussions entirely private.

#### **7. Be willing to resolve matters cooperatively**

Where possible, aim to resolve matters through negotiation or mediation rather than through the court process. Settling outside of court is usually faster, more cost-effective and less emotionally draining. It also supports more respectful communication—something especially important when ongoing co-parenting is required.

It’s understandable that many people want their “day in court,” particularly when they feel wronged or unheard. However, court proceedings rarely provide the emotional closure people hope for. The process can be lengthy, expensive and emotionally exhausting. Even if you need court involvement, remain open to settlement opportunities at every stage.

#### **8. Be receptive to advice**

Throughout your matter, you will receive guidance from various professionals, your lawyer, barrister, valuers, child experts, mediators or judicial officers. At times, their advice may be unexpected or difficult to accept. Remember, their role is to give you an informed and realistic assessment based on their experience and expertise.

You are, of course, free to make your own decisions. However, if you choose not to follow advice, make sure you fully understand the possible implications. Genuine consideration of professional advice is key to achieving the best possible outcome.

#### **9. Prioritise your wellbeing**

Separation and family disputes can be emotionally taxing. Maintaining your wellbeing helps you stay calm, think clearly and make balanced decisions. While your legal team is here to support you, they are not mental health professionals, and emotional care is an essential part of the process.

If you are struggling, seek professional support such as counselling or therapy. Speak with your lawyer about affordable options that suit your circumstances. 

At **Hazel Family Law & Mediation**, we are happy to work collaboratively with your broader support team, whether that includes family members, counsellors, financial advisors or others, so you feel supported from every angle.
