Navigating family change can be one of life’s most challenging experiences. For many, the process of separation or parenting disputes can bring up memories of distress, fear, or loss; and for some, these experiences may involve trauma. At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, we recognise that legal guidance is most effective when it is delivered with understanding, patience and awareness. This is the foundation of what is known as trauma-informed care.

## **What Is trauma-informed care?**

Trauma-informed care is an approach that recognises the widespread impact of trauma and understands that people’s experiences of distress can affect how they think, feel and respond, including during stressful legal processes.

In simple terms, it means acknowledging that trauma is real and that it can influence every aspect of how a person engages with their lawyer, the court or mediation. Rather than focusing solely on legal issues, a trauma informed approach considers the whole person and strives to create a safe, supportive environment where they can participate fully and make clear, confident decisions.

Trauma can arise from many sources, historical experiences,  family violence, coercive control, financial abuse, neglect, or even prior experiences with the legal system. It can affect anyone. A trauma informed lawyer understands these effects and tailors their communication and approach to reduce stress and avoid re-traumatisation.

## **Why it matters in family law**

Family law matters often unfold at deeply emotional times, where clients are already vulnerable. For someone who has experienced trauma, traditional legal processes, with their adversarial tone, deadlines and detailed questioning, can sometimes feel overwhelming or even unsafe.

Adopting a trauma informed approach ensures that every interaction, from the first phone call to final resolution, is handled with care and awareness. It allows the lawyer to recognise signs of trauma, respond appropriately and create space for clients to feel seen and supported.

In practical terms, trauma informed practice in family law might include:

* **Creating physical and emotional safety**: ensuring meetings and communications occur in environments where the client feels secure.

* **Promoting choice and control**: empowering clients to set boundaries and make decisions at a pace that works for them.

* **Building trust and transparency**: explaining legal steps clearly, so clients know what to expect and feel informed throughout the process.

* **Recognising and respecting emotional triggers**: understanding that certain questions or topics may be distressing and adjusting communication accordingly.

* **Collaborating with support professionals**: working alongside counsellors, psychologists or social workers to ensure holistic care.
*

This approach does not slow down the legal process: it enhances it. When clients feel safe, informed and respected, they can participate more effectively and make better decisions for themselves and their families.

## **What it means for clients**

For clients, trauma informed care means being treated with empathy and dignity. It means your lawyer listens, truly listens, and adapts their approach to meet your needs.

At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, this may look like:

* Taking time to explain each step before it happens, so you feel prepared and in control.
* Offering flexible ways to communicate, whether that is in person, online, or through written updates, to suit your comfort level.

* Being mindful of the language we use, avoiding legal jargon and using plain, reassuring communication.

* Allowing breaks during meetings or mediation if emotions become overwhelming.

* Encouraging the involvement of your support team; family members, therapists or advocates, where appropriate.


Our aim is to ensure that the legal process does not add to the distress you may already be experiencing. Instead, we want to create an environment where you feel supported, understood and empowered to make the choices that are right for you.

## **How trauma-informed practice supports better outcomes**

When clients feel emotionally safe and respected, they are better able to engage with the legal process, remember key information and make thoughtful decisions. That can lead to clearer communication, more effective negotiation, and ultimately, more sustainable and peaceful resolutions.

Trauma informed care also benefits families and children. When parents are supported and guided in a calm, compassionate way, they are better equipped to focus on what matters most, their children’s wellbeing and stability. A trauma informed approach helps reduce conflict and fosters a more constructive environment, allowing all parties to work toward balanced, child-focused outcomes.

Importantly, this approach also enhances property and financial discussions.

For many separating couples, conversations about money, assets, and financial contributions can be highly charged and emotionally confronting, especially where there has been financial control, coercion or imbalance during the relationship. A trauma informed lawyer recognises these sensitivities and ensures that discussions occur in a way that minimises distress and promotes fairness. By creating space for clients to express their concerns without fear or shame, and by proceeding at a pace that feels safe, the process becomes more transparent and constructive. This often leads to more practical and balanced financial settlements, outcomes reached through clarity and respect, rather than pressure or fear.
