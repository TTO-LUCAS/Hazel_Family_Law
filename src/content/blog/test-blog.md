When a child’s time with a parent needs to be supervised, it can be difficult to know how to explain to a child what is happening, and why. Whether supervision is needed because of safety concerns, a long period apart, or ongoing conflict between parents, it is natural to feel uncertain about what to say. With the right approach, however, you can help your child feel calm, safe and supported throughout the process.



## **What is professional supervision?**

Professional supervision is a structured arrangement designed to ensure that a child can spend time with a parent in a safe and supported environment.

It may be recommended in situations involving:

* Family violence or safety concerns;

* High levels of parental conflict;

* Questions around a parent’s capacity or circumstances; or

* The need to reintroduce a parent to a child after time apart.


Supervised visits can take place at a professional contact centre, in a public setting such as a park or library, or sometimes in someone’s home. A qualified, independent supervisor is present for the duration of the visit, including during changeover. The supervisor observes the interaction, takes notes, and prepares a report that may be provided to both parents (or their lawyers) and, where required, to the Court.

The purpose of professional supervision is to help a child maintain a relationship with their parent in a way that protects them from physical, emotional, or psychological harm, and shields them from parental conflict.

This principle is underpinned by section 60CC of the *Family Law Act 1975* (Cth), which guides how the Court determines what is in a child’s best interests. Key considerations include:

* Promoting the child’s safety and protection from exposure to family violence, abuse, neglect or harm;

* Assessing each parent’s capacity to meet the child’s emotional, developmental, and cultural needs; and

* Supporting a relationship with both parents, where it is safe to do so.


## **The practicalities, cost, frequency and duration**

Professional supervision is usually provided by independent contact centres or private supervisors.

* **Cost:** Fees vary depending on the provider and location, but typically range from $80 to $150 per hour for centre-based supervision. Community-based supervision will likely cost more. Weekend visits are usually more expensive than weekday visits. Some providers also charge for intake interviews, changeovers and written reports.

* **Frequency:** How often supervision occurs depends on the child’s needs, any court orders and progress between visits. Often, financial constraints and availability of supervisors, will limit visits to less than the supervised parent would like. Some families begin with short, weekly sessions; others start less frequently and gradually increase the length or regularity of visits as circumstances improve.

* **Who pays:** Usually the parent whose time is supervised will be asked to pay, although the Court and the parties can agree otherwise.

* **Duration:** Professional supervision is not intended to be an indefinite arrangement. It is usually a temporary and transitional measure, allowing a parent-child relationship to continue safely while risk factors are managed or trust is rebuilt. Over time, and with positive progress, supervision can often move toward unsupervised or more flexible arrangements. If a child cannot transition safely into unsupervised time, then it may be that the Court needs to decide how best to manage the relationship, potentially limiting time to quarterly or bi-monthly visits only.



## **New requirements for professional supervisors**

In recent years, new national standards have been introduced to strengthen the quality and safety of supervised contact services. If you are choosing or working with a professional supervisor, it is important to be aware of these evolving requirements:

* **Accreditation and training:** Supervisors must now meet minimum standards for training and suitability. This includes completing recognised supervision or child-contact service training and engaging in ongoing professional development.

* **Independence:** Supervisors must be independent, they cannot be a family member, friend, or therapist of either parent, and must be free from any conflict of interest.

* **Accredited services:** National accreditation standards for Children’s Contact Services are being implemented, with formal accreditation to apply across Australia from June 2025. Parents should confirm that their chosen service or supervisor complies with these standards.

* **Child-safety checks:** Supervisors and service providers must hold appropriate child-safety clearances, such as a Working With Children Check and a police history check, and have no record of relevant domestic or child-protection orders.

* **Record keeping:** Supervisors are required to keep detailed and accurate records of visits, including observations, incidents, and compliance with court orders, and may be called upon to produce reports for the Court.


When selecting a supervision service, ask about:

* The supervisor’s qualifications and experience;

* How the service ensures compliance with child-safety and professional standards; and

* Whether the service is, or will soon be, accredited under the new national framework.


These reforms aim to ensure that supervised contact arrangements remain safe, transparent, and consistent across Australia, while reinforcing that supervised time should be a stepping stone toward more independent contact where safe and appropriate.



## **Talking to children about supervision**

Explaining supervised time to a child can feel daunting, especially if they have experienced family conflict or if it has been some time since they last saw their parent. The way you approach this conversation will depend on your child’s age, maturity and understanding, as well as the reasons supervision is needed.

Here are some gentle, practical suggestions:

* **Use clear and simple language.** Explain who they will be seeing, where the visit will take place, and what will happen in straightforward, age-appropriate terms.

* **Reassure them about safety.** Let your child know that another adult will be there to make sure everyone feels safe and comfortable. You might explain that no one is in trouble, the supervisor is simply there to help the visit go smoothly.

* **Familiarise them with the setting.** If possible, visit the location in advance so your child feels more comfortable on the day.

* **Seek professional support.** If your child is seeing a psychologist or counsellor, they can help you find the right words and may raise the topic in a therapeutic setting.

* **Direct them to reliable information.** Older children and teenagers may wish to explore the **Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia’s “Kids’ Zone”** at[ www.fcfcoa.gov.au/kids](https://www.fcfcoa.gov.au/kids). This website provides child-friendly explanations about family law, court processes, and, in brief, what supervised time means.


Encouraging your child to access clear, age-appropriate information can help reduce confusion or anxiety, and help them feel reassured that many families experience similar arrangements.
