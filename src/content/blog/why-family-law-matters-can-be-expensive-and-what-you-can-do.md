Navigating family change is never easy. When lawyers become involved, emotional stress is often compounded by financial strain. At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, we believe it’s important to be open and honest about why costs can escalate, so that you can make informed, confident decisions with clarity.

## **Why so many costs?**

#### **1. Multiple Layers of Work**

When you engage legal services in family law matters, whether for parenting arrangements, property settlement or relocation, there is often far more work involved than most people anticipate. That can include gathering documents, advising you, drafting applications, negotiating, preparing for mediation, managing disclosure, consulting with experts, attending court events and more. Each step requires time, care and expertise.

Hourly rates for specialist family lawyers in Australia typically range between **$350 and $1,000 (plus GST)** per hour. As a general guide:

* **Senior solicitors** (Principals, Partners or Special Counsel): $550 to $1,000 per hour

* **Mid-tier solicitors** (Senior Associates or Associates, with 4 to 10 years’ experience): $450 to $650 per hour

* **Junior solicitors** (1 to 4 years’ experience): $350 – $500 per hour


Not all family lawyers charge the same, and there are valid reasons for that. Rates generally reflect a combination of experience, specialisation, and practice setting. Solicitors with many years of focused family law experience tend to charge more than generalist practitioners.

Location also matters: firms with offices in city centres often have higher overheads than suburban or regional practices, and those costs can flow through to client fees. The size and structure of the firm also play a role. Larger firms typically have higher fixed costs, while boutique firms may offer more flexibility.

Finally, a lawyer’s ethical stance on billing and firm overheads can make a real difference. At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, our approach is grounded in fairness and transparency, ensuring fees are proportionate to the work required and always clearly explained.

#### **2. Court fees and compulsory expenses**

Even if your matter settles early, there are mandatory external costs that cannot be avoided such as court filing fees, hearing fees and expert reports. For example, the current filing fee for initiating a combined parenting and financial application (for both interim and final orders) is approximately $585, and divorce applications are around $1,125.

#### **3. Complexity matters**

The more complex your circumstances, the greater the potential cost. When children, substantial assets, business interests or complex financial structures are involved, it may be necessary to engage valuers, child experts or other specialists.

Less complex matters might be resolved for between $5,000 and $40,000, while more complicated ones can exceed $80,000, assuming court proceedings can be avoided. Once a case enters the court system, however, costs escalate rapidly. It is not uncommon for fully contested matters to exceed $100,000 or more by the time they reach trial.

#### **4. Time, delay and the adversarial process**

The longer a matter continues, the more legal time is required and the higher the cost. A recent *ABC News* investigation (*“$1m on legal fees and feeling powerless”*, 2024) reported parents spending over $300,000 on legal fees, mediation and expert reports, only to have their matter adjourned on the first day of hearing.

Delay adds not just to cost but to emotional exhaustion. It can also erode goodwill, making cooperation and settlement harder as time passes.

#### **5. Expectations and behaviour can influence cost**

While many families find themselves caught in costly proceedings through no fault of their own, sometimes expectations or behaviour can unintentionally drive conflict and expense. Unrealistic expectations, often shaped by no, poor or overly optimistic legal advice can lead to prolonged disputes and disappointment.

In other situations, one party may unfortunately use the legal process as a means of maintaining control, creating financial or emotional pressure on the other parent. The family law system is designed to promote fairness and protect children’s wellbeing, but it can be misused when cooperation and good faith are lost.

## **Why this matters to you**

It is not only about money. When costs escalate:

* The budget you hoped to dedicate to your or your children’s future may instead be consumed by legal fees.

* Time, energy and emotional resources are drawn into the dispute rather than constructive family change.

* The original issues can become overshadowed by the process itself.


At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, we believe you deserve a process that is respectful, cost-aware and focused on resolution. We also understand that in some circumstances, particularly where there are safety concerns or ongoing family violence, the court process is necessary and appropriate.

## **What you can do to help manage costs**

You have some control over how the process unfolds. There are practical ways to reduce cost and maintain focus:

* Be clear about your goals early. The sooner you and your lawyer identify your objectives and assess what is realistic, the less time and cost will be spent refining strategy later.

* Choose mediation or negotiation where possible. A November 2024 *Relationships Australia Victoria* report found that for every $1 spent on family dispute resolution, families saved about $20 in avoided court costs (an average saving of around $41,800).

* Keep documentation and disclosure organised. Missing or incomplete information causes delay and duplication. Being proactive and cooperative helps streamline your matter.

* Be realistic about complexity and timeline. Recognise early if your case involves multiple issues (such as children, business interests or relocation) and plan accordingly.

* Discuss budget and strategy openly. Ask your lawyer for realistic estimates, and talk about when it may be time to negotiate or settle.

* Stay child-focused. Keeping discussions centred on what is best for your children, rather than on winning, usually leads to faster, healthier and more affordable outcomes.

* Ask your lawyer how you can minimise costs. Sometimes small habits, for example. consolidating questions into one email rather than sending several, can make a meaningful difference.

## **Finally**

Family law matters are rarely simple. The stakes; your children, your family’s future and your financial stability are deeply personal. Costs can mount quickly when the process becomes protracted or adversarial. With early, honest advice and a thoughtful strategy, you can stay in control of both the process and the outcome.

At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, we are committed to guiding you through with **clarity, compassion, and resolution**. We’ll help you understand your options, make informed decisions, and work toward outcomes that support your family’s wellbeing, while being mindful of cost.
