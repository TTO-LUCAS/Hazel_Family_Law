Navigating maintenance can be confusing, and many people are unsure whether they, or their former partner, are eligible to make a claim. We provide clear, practical advice to help you understand your options and make informed decisions.

Maintenance (for de-facto couples) and Spousal Maintenance (for married couples) is a payment from one party to the other to help meet financial needs following the breakdown of the relationship. These payments are separate from child support or adult child maintenance, which address the needs of children.

Some of the areas we can assist with include:

* Assessing eligibility for maintenance based on both parties’ income, expenses and circumstances

* Advising on the other party’s potential entitlements

* Assisting with making or responding to a maintenance claim

* Ensuring claims meet legal requirements and time limits

Maintenance can be structured as a one-off lump sum or as ongoing periodic payments, depending on your circumstances. We focus on practical, tailored solutions that consider your financial position and future needs.

Early advice is essential. By seeking guidance at the right time, you can make decisions with confidence and ensure your financial security is protected throughout the separation process**.**
