Family Dispute Resolution (FDR) is a form of mediation designed to help separating families have constructive, forward-looking conversations about parenting, financial and property matters.



At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, we provide a calm, supportive environment where both parties can share their perspectives, explore practical options and work toward agreements that prioritise the wellbeing of children and fair financial outcomes for everyone involved.



The mediation is facilitated by an independent, accredited Family Dispute Resolution Practitioner (FDRP), whose role is to guide communication, reduce conflict, and help parties find resolution. They do not take sides or make decisions for you, instead, they help you reach outcomes that you can both live with.



Elisa Turco, Principal Lawyer at Hazel Family Law & Mediation, is an accredited FDRP with over 14 years of experience. She understands the profound benefits that can come from reaching agreement through open dialogue, rather than through court proceedings.



In most parenting disputes, attending FDR is required before applying to the Court, unless exceptional circumstances apply, such as safety concerns or urgency. The Court also strongly encourages families to attempt mediation for property and financial matters before litigation.



At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, we can facilitate FDR with or without lawyer involvement, depending on your circumstances and comfort level. Our process is adaptable and trauma-informed, ensuring that participants who have experienced family violence can engage safely and with appropriate support.

### **The FDR Process**



**1. Intake Session**
 The process begins with a separate, confidential intake session for each participant.

* Conducted by phone (approximately one hour)
* Helps assess whether FDR is suitable for your situation
* Allows the FDRP to understand the background, key issues and any safety concerns
* Allows each participant to understand the FDR process and get information regarding family law matters (not family law advice)



**2. Mediation Session**
 If FDR is suitable, a mediation session will be scheduled.

* **Full-day conference (up to 7 hours):** recommended for complex matters involving multiple or overlapping issues (such as both parenting and property).
* **Half-day conference (up to 4 hours):** suitable for focused discussions on either parenting or property matters.
* Sessions are usually in-person, although online attendance may be arranged at the FDRP’s discretion.



If FDR does not result in an agreement, the FDRP may issue a Section 60I Certificate, which is required before commencing court proceedings for parenting matters.



If Elisa acts as your FDRP, she cannot also act as your lawyer or give you legal advice in the same matter should the dispute proceed beyond mediation.
