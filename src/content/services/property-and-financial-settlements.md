Dividing assets and liabilities after a separation or divorce can feel overwhelming, but the right guidance makes a significant difference. We provide clear, practical advice and support to help you navigate property and financial settlements with confidence. Whether your finances are straightforward or complex, we work to ensure your interests are protected and your settlement is fair.

Property settlement under the Family Law Act involves much more than dividing the family home. Bank accounts, superannuation, vehicles, investments, and even business interests can all be part of the equation. Liabilities, such as loans, credit cards, or personal debts, also need to be considered.Each party’s financial and non-financial contributions, along with the future needs of any children, are considered when determining a settlement. The law also takes into account factors such as family violence and any significant misuse of financial resources.

We aim to resolve property matters efficiently and amicably where possible. When negotiation is in your best interest, we handle discussions with the other party to achieve a fair outcome, while ensuring all agreements are properly documented and legally binding.

Every family’s financial situation is unique. Some households include multiple properties, investment portfolios, superannuation funds, trusts, businesses, or overseas assets. For other families, financial resources are limited or significant debts need to be divided. Whether you are well-versed in your finances or need guidance, we help you navigate the process with clarity and care to protect your interests.

Advice from friends or family may be well-meaning, but professional legal guidance helps you understand your options and your rights. Experienced legal advice is essential. We frequently collaborate with clients’ accountants and financial planners to ensure every aspect is considered and the best outcome is achieved.

We can provide guidance on your specific circumstances, negotiate on your behalf, and help secure a fair and lasting settlement. From initial advice through to finalising agreements, we prioritise clarity, compassion, and resolution at every step.
