At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, we believe that genuine care extends beyond legal outcomes, it encompasses the wellbeing of both our clients and our team. Family law matters are often deeply personal and emotionally complex, and supporting the people involved is central to how we work.

We are proud to have signed up to the Minds Count TJMF Best Practice Guidelines for the Legal Profession, reflecting our commitment to fostering a respectful, mentally healthy and supportive workplace. By prioritising open communication, balance and psychological safety, we ensure our team can deliver their best work with empathy and focus.

For our clients, that commitment translates to a calm, considered, and trauma-informed experience. We recognise that family and financial change can be profoundly stressful, so we take the time to understand each person’s circumstances and support their overall wellbeing. Where helpful, we can work with clients’ existing mental health supports or connect them with trusted mental health professionals, counsellors and other community services to ensure comprehensive support both legally and personally.

We also actively support the **[Victorian Legal Services Board + Commissioner (VLSB+C)](https://lsbc.vic.gov.au/)** and the **[Law Institute of Victoria (LIV)](https://www.liv.asn.au/)** in their initiatives to promote mental health and wellbeing across the legal profession.

At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, we know that when people feel supported and valued, whether clients or colleagues, they are better equipped to find clarity, compassion and resolution.
