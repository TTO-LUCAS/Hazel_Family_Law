Separating from a partner can be overwhelming and emotionally challenging. There’s a lot to think about; from arranging where everyone will live, to managing finances, and making interim arrangements for your children.

Whether you are married or in a de facto relationship, talking to a specialist family lawyer early on can help you understand your options and make decisions with confidence. Even if you are only considering separation, having a conversation with us can provide valuable insight and help you plan for the future.

The choices made in the early days of separation, or even just before, can have lasting effects. Getting advice early often gives you more flexibility, better protects your interests, and can make the process smoother for everyone involved.

We can help you with parenting arrangements, living arrangements, and provide guidance on what to expect throughout the separation process. For those who have already separated, we offer mediation, negotiation, and court representation if needed, always with a focus on practical, cost-effective solutions.

We know this can be a difficult and stressful time. At Hazel Family Law & Mediation, our priority is to support you with understanding, clarity, and compassion, helping you navigate this period and achieve the best possible outcomes for you and your family.

#### *The difference between separation and divorce*

While separation and divorce share some legal aspects, they are not the same. Separation happens when one partner communicates their intention to end the relationship, whether in a marriage or a de facto partnership. Couples can resolve their parenting and property settlement matters without getting a divorce.

Every family’s circumstances are unique. Advice from friends or family may be well-meaning, but professional legal guidance helps you understand your options, your rights, and your responsibilities. We work closely with you to provide clear, practical advice so you can move forward with confidence and peace of mind.
