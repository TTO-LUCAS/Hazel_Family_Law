No one enters a relationship expecting it to end, however planning for the future can offer stability and peace of mind. A Financial Agreement is a legally recognised way for couples, whether married, de facto, or in same-sex relationships, to set out how their assets, liabilities, and financial resources will be managed if the relationship breaks down.

These agreements are governed by the Family Law Act 1975 and must meet strict legal requirements to be valid and binding. To be binding, each party must:

* Sign the agreement;

* Receive independent legal advice about its effect on their rights; and

* Understand the advantages and disadvantages of entering into the agreement.

A Financial Agreement can be made at any stage, before, during, or after a relationship. In addition to outlining how property and financial resources will be divided, a Financial Agreement can also address issues such as maintenance or ongoing support for adult children.

We understand that discussions about finances and future planning can feel sensitive and complex. We approach each matter with clarity and compassion, ensuring that your agreement reflects your intentions and provides long-term security.

We can assist you with:

* Preparing or reviewing a Financial Agreement tailored to your circumstances

* Providing independent legal advice on an agreement prepared by your partner

* Negotiating terms that protect your financial interests now and in the future

* Drafting a FInancial alongside consent orders for added certainty

* Amending, setting aside, or ending an existing FInancial Agreement where circumstances have changed

Financial Agreements must meet specific legal and procedural standards; it’s essential to have expert advice from the outset. We ensure your agreement is properly prepared, fully compliant with the law, and designed to stand the test of time.
