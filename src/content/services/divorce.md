After a separation, applying for a divorce can help you bring closure to that chapter of your life and move forward with confidence. Once you have been living apart for at least 12 months, you may be eligible to finalise your separation through divorce. Even if you and your partner have been living separately under the same roof, we can guide you through the requirements and help you obtain a divorce order.

We can provide comprehensive support throughout the divorce process, including:

* Explaining the legal requirements for obtaining a divorce
* Preparing and lodging all necessary court documents, such as parenting orders, affidavits, and witness statements
* Serving your spouse with the divorce application if it is not a joint application

* Responding to or opposing a divorce application when required

* Representing you in court, if necessary

We aim to make the process as straightforward and stress-free as possible, providing guidance, clarity, and practical support every step of the way.

If you prefer to manage the divorce application yourself, we can guide and support you through the process, helping you complete and submit it correctly while keeping your costs down.

#### *The difference between separation and divorce*

While separation and divorce share some legal aspects, they are not the same. Separation happens when one partner communicates their intention to end the relationship, whether in a marriage or a de facto partnership. Couples can resolve their parenting and property settlement matters without getting a divorce.

Every family’s circumstances are unique. Advice from friends or family may be well-meaning, but professional legal guidance helps you understand your options, your rights, and your responsibilities. We work closely with you to provide clear, practical advice so you can move forward with confidence and peace of mind.
