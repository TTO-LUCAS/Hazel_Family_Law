We are proud to support individuals and families within the LGBTIQA+ community with understanding, inclusivity and respect.



Under the Family Law Act 1975, LGBTIQA+ relationships are treated in the same way as heterosexual relationships when it comes to property, maintenance and parenting matters. However, we recognise that some unique legal and emotional challenges can arise, particularly around issues such as parentage, surrogacy, and family formation.



We provide tailored advice and representation across all areas of family law, including:

* Preparing and advising on property and spousal maintenance agreements
* Assisting with divorce or separation, including the preparation of court documents
* Developing parenting plans and interim and final parenting arrangements
* Conducting mediation and Family Dispute Resolution to reach amicable outcomes
* Advising on child support obligations and formalising agreements through the Child Support Agency or Court
* Providing guidance on specific legal issues unique to LGBTIQA+ families and relationships



Family violence can occur in any relationship, and we understand that members of the LGBTIQA+ community can face additional barriers when seeking help, including stigma, discrimination, or fear of not being understood.



We offer a safe, confidential and non-judgmental space for all clients. We can assist you in applying for or responding to Intervention Orders and provide practical, compassionate guidance to help you regain a sense of safety and control.



Whether you are separating, navigating parenting arrangements, or planning for the future with a financial agreement, our family lawyers provide advice that is clear, inclusive and relevant to your circumstances.



From the very first conversation, we listen carefully to your concerns and priorities, helping you make informed decisions and move forward with confidence. If court proceedings become necessary, we advocate strongly on your behalf to achieve the best possible outcome for you and your family.



Our commitment to clarity, compassion, and resolution extends to every client, because every family deserves to feel supported, respected and understood.
