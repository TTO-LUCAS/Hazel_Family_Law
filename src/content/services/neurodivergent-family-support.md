We recognise that every family is unique, and that families with members who are Autistic or who have other neurodevelopmental or sensory differences may face additional challenges during times of family change.

We approach every matter with sensitivity, understanding and respect for neurodivergent needs. We take the time to understand your family’s circumstances, communication preferences, and daily realities so we can provide practical advice that truly supports you and your children.

We are experienced in assisting families where Autism, ADHD or other differences play a role in parenting arrangements, decision-making or care planning. We know that flexibility, structure, and empathy are key to creating workable outcomes that meet the needs of every family member.

We provide clear, compassionate guidance across all areas of family law, including:

* Parenting arrangements that reflect each child’s individual needs, routines, and support structures

* Advocacy for tailored care plans and communication arrangements that work best for neurodivergent children and parents

* Negotiation and mediation conducted with patience, understanding, and attention to sensory or emotional considerations

* Advice and representation in property, financial or spousal maintenance matters where additional care needs or therapy costs are relevant

* Assistance with Court proceedings, ensuring that the unique needs of neurodivergent children are properly understood and represented

We understand that change and uncertainty can be especially challenging for families with neurodivergent members. That’s why we prioritise calm communication, predictable processes and clear explanations at every stage. Our goal is to help you make informed decisions and move forward with confidence, knowing your family’s needs have been heard and respected.

Our values of clarity, compassion, and resolution guide everything we do. We are committed to supporting families of all kinds with understanding, care and genuine respect for every individual’s experience.
