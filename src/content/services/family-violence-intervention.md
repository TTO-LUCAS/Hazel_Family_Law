We understand that issues involving family violence are deeply distressing and can have far-reaching impacts on you, your family and your future. Whether you need protection from violence or have been accused of family violence, we are here to guide you with care, discretion and understanding.

Family violence, sometimes referred to as domestic or intimate partner violence, is a serious issue that requires both sensitivity and strong legal support. An Intervention Order is made by the Court to protect a person or their family from harm or harassment by restricting another person’s behaviour or contact.

If you are considering applying for an Intervention Order, or if an order has been made against you, it is important to understand how it may affect your circumstances, including parenting arrangements, property settlements or ongoing court matters.

We can assist you in:

* Applying for an Intervention Order to ensure your safety and that of your family

* Responding to or defending an Intervention Order made against you

* Understanding the legal implications of an Intervention Order on your parenting or property matter

* Negotiating safe and practical arrangements for contact or communication between parties where children are involved
* Representing you in court proceedings related to family violence
* Liaising with support services and ensuring you have access to resources and protection

Breaching the conditions of an Intervention Order is a criminal offence, and the courts take these matters seriously. Our role is to make sure you fully understand your rights, responsibilities and options so you can make informed decisions.

We know that each situation is unique. We have extensive experience in supporting both those affected by family violence and those facing allegations. We approach every case with empathy and respect, ensuring that your voice is heard and your safety and dignity remain central to the process.
