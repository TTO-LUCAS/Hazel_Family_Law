Providing financial support for your children or dependent adult children is a key part of ensuring their wellbeing after separation. Navigating child support and maintenance can be complex, so having expert guidance is essential.



We understand the financial demands of raising children through childhood, adolescence, and into early adulthood. We work with you to make sure your children are supported now and in the years to come.

\
Even after turning 18, many young people continue in high school, TAFE, or university and are not yet able to support themselves. For some children, ongoing medical or mental health needs mean they may require financial support well into adulthood. Our goal is to ensure your children’s financial needs are met, providing stability and peace of mind.



Some of the areas we can assist with include:

* Understanding each parent’s child support responsibilities, including how much should be received or paid
* Preparing and submitting child support or adult child maintenance assessments
* Responding to claims for child support or adult maintenance
* Reviewing and advising on agreements drafted with your former partner
* Registering agreements with the Child Support Agency (CSA) or seeking Court consent orders for adult children**.**

With clear advice and practical support, we help you manage child and adult child maintenance matters efficiently and confidently, ensuring your family is protected every step of the way.
