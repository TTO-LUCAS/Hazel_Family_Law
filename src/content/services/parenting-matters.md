We are here to support you in achieving the best outcome for your family.

Separation can be overwhelming, especially if it is your first time navigating parenting arrangements. Knowing what to consider now and for the future is essential. We take the time to ask the right questions to understand your priorities and goals, then work with you to develop a plan that reflects your wishes. At every stage, we place your children’s best interests at the heart of our advice, taking their needs, and where appropriate, their wishes, into account.

Every family is unique, and parenting arrangements can be highly emotional. Our goal is to help you reach a resolution that works for everyone, with clear documentation to reduce the potential for future conflict. Some of the areas we can assist with include:

* Where the children will live, including arrangements for school holidays and special occasions

* Decisions about relocation, including moving interstate or overseas

* How major decisions will be made regarding schooling, extracurricular activities, health, and medical care

* Arrangements for communication between children and the other parent when apart

* Which parent holds important documents, such as birth certificates and passports
* If relevant, ensuring you and your children are safe.


Depending on your situation, we can prepare interim orders, final orders and parenting plans, negotiate with the other parent, conduct, attend or support you through private mediation sessions or the Family Dispute Resolution process, and provide representation in Court, if needed.

With your priorities in mind, we help you create a clear, practical plan that supports your children and sets the stage for a positive future.
